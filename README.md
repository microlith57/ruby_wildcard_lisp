# `ruby_wildcard_lisp`

An experimental programming language, built in Ruby. Made as a spinoff of WildcardLISP, from Hundred Rabbits' project [Paradise](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Paradise).

(Please don't use this anywhere important. It is not nearly finished, has loads of bugs, and was built in several weeks without looking at Paradise source code.)
